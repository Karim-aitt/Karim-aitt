## Hallo!

> I'm Karim, a web developer. Currently, I specialize in [Vue]() and [React](), although I've also worked with [Angular](). While I've spent

I consider myself someone who loves to "create" and constantly evolve by learning new technologies and their applications.

If you're looking to share ideas, chat about code, or just network, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm very friendly. ðŸ˜ƒ
