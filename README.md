# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Karim.

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm a Junior Web Developer student from Spain, who is currently cursing a bootcamp at 4Geeks.
I am very enthusiastic about internet culture, web/app developing, videogames and all stuff which include something geek. ðŸ‘¾

I self learned most things I know, I'm very pro-active, positive and I love to learn new things. ðŸ˜º

* Actually learning React
